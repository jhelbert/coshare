Things to do:

	-albums is very fucked up
		-most likely just from the section of code where we are adding albums
		-worked on my code, now is failing after I pulled from last night
		-not adding to correct divs of id's dynamic-albums and static-albums

	-add icons for user generated
	-make the playlists look better
	-make sure the nav bars are consistent 
	
	-add album title
	-look into subtitles for albums
	-new playlists bigger
	-background for albums
	
	-content layout
		-less margins, pictures bigger
